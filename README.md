# Bachelor's Thesis

This Bachelor's Thesis was conducted at the Australian National University (ANU) as a collaboration between the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Transformative Meta-Optical Systems (TMOS) and the Centre for Gravitational Astrophysics, both based at the ANU Research School of Physics. The project was supervised by Prof. Dr. Dragomir Neshev and Prof. Dr. Chathura Bandutunga.

The work focused on the development of a compact, high-sensitivity sensor capable of detecting extremely low analyte concentrations using metasurface dispersion spectroscopy â€” a novel approach in the field of optical sensing. The research contributes to the development of next-generation sensors with potential applications in improving water quality monitoring and hygiene, particularly in underserved regions.
